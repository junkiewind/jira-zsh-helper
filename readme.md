Simple zsh script which allows you to enter just the NUMBERs of Jira issues and get concatenated string of keys with prefix, comma and quotes so that you can simply use this in your JQL. 
Also, script open all issues in Issue navigator in your browser.

Currently working in zsh on OSX only, but I have a plan to make it also work in Windows and bash.
Check comments in script to see configuration options
